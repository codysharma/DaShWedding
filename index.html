              <h3>2016</h3>
              <p>Like good Desi kids, we met on a Bhangra team in Cambridge in the fall of 2016. Shivang was in law school, Damini was working, and both of them lacked just enough self-respect to join an undergraduate Bhangra team as non-undergrads. After some failed flirting they ended up watching Dr. Strange together, after which Damini asked Shivang to confirm that they were, in fact, on a date. </p>

              <p>We took our relationship to the next level in the summer of 2017 when Shivang flew to New Jersey from his internship in California for 36 hours of Meeting The Family and attending the IIFA awards.  </p>

              <h3>2018</h3>
              <p>By summer of 2018, we decided we were serious enough about each other to embark on the next step: Long Distance. Shivang was moving to California after graduation, and Damini was moving to Chicago for grad school. But we ended our time in Cambridge with a bang, complete with attending Shivang’s law school prom.   </p>

              <h3>2019</h3>
              <p>Long distance had its ups and downs, but we made it work with frequent visits and calls. In the summer of 2019 Shivang joined Damini in Italy for their first-ever international trip together. Traveling with someone reveals a lot about someone and we learned that we were shockingly incompatible travelers. Damini wanted to show Shivang the wonders of Rome, but Shivang just wanted to find a good burger (in Italy?!) and some AC. If this wasn’t going to be enough to drive them apart, nothing would. </p>

Adjusting to life together, in a suburb, during a pandemic was hard. We barely scraped by with our sanity intact, with the help of lots of TV, snapchat filters, and some getaways with our friends who were also going stir crazy. </p>

              <p>In the fall of 2021, we made some necessary lifestyle changes and moved up to San Francisco. In the best twist, Tanvi moved to SF at the same time, and she and Cody became regular fixtures of our SF lives. They taught us how to adult and set us up for success in the city. Tan helped furnish and decorate our house and adopted us into her Rice friends community, and Cody taught us how to cook and when trying to teach Damini how to drive wore Shivang’s patience down, Cody took over as Damini’s driving teacher.</p>

We took a month off work (we’re very proud about this) and leaned into the Mumbai monsoon season with mangoes, pau bhaji dosas, Red Bull, cocktails, and lots of quality family time.</p>

              <p>By the winter of 2023, our families had had enough of our unwillingness to discuss marriages and weddings, and we finally put an end to their misery while walking around the Great Sand Dunes. In all honesty, we’d probably been ready for months, but had been too busy enjoying our lives to make it official. As Damini’s newly anointed “fiancé”, Shivang obviously had to re-enact the Mufasa-Scar scene during the Sharma’s road trip to Arizona.  </p>

          <p>Especially if you’re coming to India from outside the country, you may want to extend your trip and explore more places. An easy way to do this around Jaipur is to complete the Golden Triangle: Delhi-Agra-Jaipur. This is a great road or train trip, though you can also fly between the cities. 
          Of course, if you have already seen the Golden Triangle, there is no shortage of amazing destinations in India and we’d be happy to make other recommendations!

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <br>
        <p>Getting around if you haven’t rented a car for the duration of your trip:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uber and Ola app based rideshare</li>
          <li>Local taxis and auto rickshaws</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tipping norms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            10% if the bill does not include 'service charges'
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Food safety:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tap water in India is not safe to drink. Showering, washing hands, etc. is fine with tap water, but be sure any water you drink comes from unopened, sealed bottles unless you are at someone's home. This is a common practice even at restaurants, where they will open the water bottle in front of you at your table.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Weather:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In December, Jaipur ranges from 24C during the day down to 10C in the evening. It averages 4mm of rain over the month of December, so shouldn't rain on us!</li>
            <li>In December, Mumbai ranges from 27C to 16C, and 0 days of rain. </li>

      <p><em>How cold will it be?</em></p>
      <div class="answer faqAnswer">
        <p class="answer">Kind of cold! It’s winter time in Jaipur, so on average expect a high of 76F (24C) and a low of 48F (8C).  Some events including evening events will be outdoors. We will have heating lamps in the evening, but we’d encourage to you to carry cardigans, shawls or jackets to stay warm! </p>
        <p class="answer">In Mumbai, we expect pleasant weather. The event will be both indoor and outdoor – dress as you please! </p>
